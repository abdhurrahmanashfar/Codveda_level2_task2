This project implements classification models to predict categorical outcomes. The focus is on logistic regression, with comparisons to other classifiers.

## Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Features
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib`
2. Run: `python task2.py`
